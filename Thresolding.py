Certainly! Here's a detailed and understandable comment for each section of your code:

```python
import cv2
import numpy

# Read the input image in grayscale
img = cv2.imread('img_3.png', 0)

# Resize the image to a fixed size (512x512)
img = cv2.resize(img, (512, 512))

# Apply binary thresholding with a threshold value of 50
# Pixels with intensity values below 50 become black, and those above 50 become white
_, th1 = cv2.threshold(img, 50, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY)

# Apply binary inverse thresholding with a threshold value of 200
# Pixels with intensity values greater than or equal to 200 become black (0), and those below 200 become white (255)
_, th2 = cv2.threshold(img, 200, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY_INV)

# Apply truncated thresholding with a threshold value of 127
# Pixels with intensity values greater than 127 remain unchanged, while those below 127 are set to the threshold value
_, th3 = cv2.threshold(img, 127, 255, cv2.THRESH_TRUNC)

# Apply thresholding to zero with a threshold value of 127
# Pixels with intensity values greater than 127 remain unchanged, while those below 127 are set to zero (black)
_, th4 = cv2.threshold(img, 127, 255, cv2.THRESH_TOZERO)

# Apply inverse thresholding to zero with a threshold value of 127
# Pixels with intensity values greater than 127 are set to zero, while those below 127 remain unchanged
_, th5 = cv2.threshold(img, 127, 255, cv2.THRESH_TOZERO_INV)

# Display the original image and thresholded images
cv2.imshow('image', img)
cv2.imshow('thres', th1)
cv2.imshow('thre', th2)
cv2.imshow('thr', th3)
cv2.imshow('th', th4)
cv2.imshow('the', th5)

# Wait for a key press and close all windows
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```
