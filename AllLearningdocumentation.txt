                                                                          17. MORPHOLOGICAL TRANSFORMATION :
1. Morphological transformation are basically performed on binary images.
2. Morphological transformations are simple operations based on the shape of an image.
3. These operations are fundamental in image processing and are useful for tasks like Noise reduction, object extraction, and boundary detection.

KERNEL : A kernel tell you how to change the value of any given pixel by combining it with different amount of neighouring pixels

Here are the basic morphological operations and how to implement them using OpenCV:
 A) Erosion:
                          Erosion erodes away the boundaries of the foreground object (usually white).
                          In erosion, it helps shrink the boundaries of white regions (foreground).
                          It slides a kernel (a small matrix) over the image and sets a pixel to 1 only if all the pixels under the kernel are 1.
                          Useful for removing small white noises and detaching connected objects.
                          Example:
                                    img = cv2.imread('j.png', cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE) # READ THE IMGAGE IN GRAY SCALE OR YOU CAN SIMPLY PUT THE FLAG ==0
                                    kernel = np.ones((5, 5), np.uint8) 
                                    erosion = cv2.erode(img, kernel, iterations=1) 

B) Dilation:
                          Dilation is the opposite of erosion.
                          In dilation, it expands the white regions.
                          A pixel becomes 1 if at least one pixel under the kernel is 1.
                          Increases the white region in the image or the size of the foreground object.
                          Useful for noise removal and joining broken parts of an object.
                          Example: 
                                    'kernel = np.ones((5, 5), np.uint8) 
                                    'dilation = cv2.dilate(img, kernel, iterations=1)


C) Morphological Opening: Opening is a sequence of two operations: erosion followed by dilation.
                          It helps remove small noise or unwanted structures while preserving the overall shape and size of larger objects.
                          Commonly used for noise reduction and object separation.
                          ex: 
                              opening = cv2.morphologyEx(mask, cv2.MORPH_OPEN, kernel)


D) Morphological Closing:
                        Closing is a sequence of two operations: dilation followed by erosion. 
                        It helps close small gaps or holes in the foreground object while preserving its overall shape.
                        Commonly used for filling gaps, joining broken parts, and smoothing object boundaries.
                        The cv2.morphologyEx() function applies the closing operation.
                        ex: 
                              closing = cv2.morphologyEx(mask , cv2.MORPH_CLOSE, kernel)


E) Morphological Gradient: 
                      The morphological gradient highlights the boundaries of objects in an image.
                      It is the difference between the dilated version and the eroded version of the input image.
                      Useful for edge detection and feature extraction.
                      ex : 
                             mgradient = cv2.morphologyEx(mask , cv2.MORPH_GRADIENT, kernel)


F) Top-Hat Transformation: 
                      The top-hat transformation highlights small, bright structures (details) in an image that are smaller than the structuring element (kernel).
                      It is the difference between the original image and the opening of the image.
                      Enhances fine details.
                      Emphasizes small bright regions.
                      Detecting small objects or subtle features.
                      Background subtraction.
                      ex: 
                          that = cv2.morphologyEx(mask , cv2.MORPH_TOPHAT, kernel)

==========================================================================================================================================================================================                                                                             
                                                                  18. Smoothing Images | Blurring Images OpenCV

To acheive smoothing and blurring we can use diverse linear filter, because linear filter easy to acheive and also fast
There are various linear filters : 1. Homogenous filter
                                   2. Guassian filter
                                   3. Median filter
                                   4. Bilateral filter


A) 2D convolution filter:
                   Convolution is like a special magic wand that transforms an image.
                   We slide a small matrix (the kernel) over the image and do some math at each position.
                   The output image (dst) gets a new look based on the kernel.
                   Ex:
                        #Image filtering using 2D convolution
                        kernel = np.ones((3, 3), np.float32) / 9
                        dst = cv2.filter2D(img, -1, kernel)
                        blur = cv2.blur(src: img, ksize: (5, 5))

     * LPF ( Low pass filter) helps in removing noise and blurring the image.
     * HPF ( high pass filter) helps in finding edges in images.

a) Guassian Filter :  
                  This filter  using different weighted kernel in bot x and y direction.
                  Gaussian blur is like gently smoothing out wrinkles in an image.
                  It averages the pixel values around each pixel using a special bell-shaped curve (Gaussian distribution).
                  Ex:
                     gblur = cv2.GaussianBlur(img, (5, 5), 0)
                  Result:
                          Reduces noise.
                          Softens edges.

                  Application:
                          Preprocessing for further analysis.
                          Creating artistic effects.

                  Kernel Size (5x5):
                          The (5, 5) specifies the size of the filter (kernel).
                          It’s like choosing how big your smoothing brush should be.
                          Larger kernel = more smoothing.

                 Standard Deviation (0):
                          The 0 indicates that the standard deviation along both X and Y axes is automatically calculated from the kernel size.
                          It’s like adjusting the strength of the smoothing effect.


b) Median Blur : 
                Median blurring is a technique used to reduce noise in an image.
                Instead of using a weighted average like Gaussian blurring, median blurring replaces each pixel’s value with the median value of its neighboring pixels.
                It is particularly effective in removing salt-and-pepper noise (random black and white pixels) from an image.
        
                Ex: 
                   cv2.medianBlur(img, 5):
                    img: The input image.
                    5: The size of the kernel (filter) used for median blurring. In this case, it’s a 5x5 kernel.

c) Bilateral Filter : 
                 Bilateral filtering is a non-linear, edge-preserving smoothing technique used to reduce noise in an image while preserving edges.
                 It replaces the intensity of each pixel with a weighted average of intensity values from nearby pixels, considering both spatial distance and intensity similarity

                 Function Parameters:
                    cv2.bilateralFilter(img, 9, 75, 75):
                          img: The input image.
                          9: The diameter of each pixel neighborhood (kernel size). A larger value includes more neighboring pixels in the computation.
                          75: The value of sigmaColor in the color space. It controls how much color similarity affects the filtering. Higher values allow colors farther apart to be 
                              mixed.
                          75: The value of sigmaSpace in the coordinate space. It determines how far pixels can mix together based on spatial distance. Larger values result in more 
                              extensive mixing within the neighborhood.

                 Comparison with Other Filters:
                
                Bilateral filtering retains edges better than average, median, and Gaussian filters.
                Below are outputs from different filters for comparison:
                Average filter: cv2.blur(img, (5, 5))
                Median filter: cv2.medianBlur(img, 5)
                Gaussian filter: cv2.GaussianBlur(img, (5, 5), 0)
                Bilateral filtering stands out by maintaining edge details while reducing noise.

                                                                          19. Image Gradients and Edge Detection
Image gradients are mathematical functions used in computer vision and image processing to determine the magnitude and direction of intensity changes in an image. 
Image gradients play a crucial role in edge detection.

How Gradients Work:
                    Gradients are calculated by taking the partial derivatives of an image function in both the horizontal and vertical directions.
                    The direction of the gradient tells us the direction in which the image is changing most rapidly.

A) Laplacian Method : 
                    The Laplacian operator is a mathematical filter used for edge detection and image enhancement.
                    It calculates the second derivative of the image intensity with respect to both x (horizontal) and y (vertical) directions.
                    The Laplacian highlights regions of rapid intensity change (edges) in an image.

                    Function Parameters:
                            cv2.Laplacian(img, cv2.CV_64F, ksize=1):
                            img: The input grayscale image.
                            cv2.CV_64F: The data type for the output image (64-bit floating point).
                            ksize=1: The size of the Laplacian kernel. Here, it’s a 1x1 kernel, it takes only odd values (only considering the central pixel).
          
                    Conversion to uint8:
                    The Laplacian result is typically a floating-point image. 
                    To display it, we convert it to an unsigned 8-bit integer (uint8) using np.uint8(np.absolute(lap)).
                    This ensures that the pixel values are within the valid range for display (0 to 255).


B) Sobel gradients:  Sobel gradients of an input image (img) in both the horizontal and vertical directions. Let’s break down what each line does:

                     Sobix = cv2.Sobel(img, cv2.CV_64F, 1, 0):
                      Computes the horizontal gradient (along the x-axis) using the Sobel operator.
                      The result is stored in the variable Sobix.
                      The cv2.CV_64F data type ensures that the output is a 64-bit floating-point image.  

                     Sobiy = cv2.Sobel(img, cv2.CV_64F, 0, 1):
                      Computes the vertical gradient (along the y-axis) using the Sobel operator.
                      The result is stored in the variable Sobiy.
                      Again, cv2.CV_64F ensures a 64-bit floating-point output.

                    Purpose:
                      The Sobel gradients help detect edges in the image.
                      By calculating the intensity changes in both directions, we can identify regions with rapid intensity transitions (edges).

c) sobelcombined = cv2.bitwise_or(Sobix, Sobiy)
                      The bitwise OR (logical OR) operation is applied element-wise to corresponding pixels in two input images.
                      For each pixel, the result is the maximum value of the corresponding pixel values in the input images.

      The canny edge detector is an edge detection operator that uses a multi-stage algorithm  to detect   a wide range of edges in images. it was devloped  by john F.canny in 1986.

  The canny edge detection algrorithm is composed of 5 steps :
1. Noise reduction.
2. Gradient calculation.
3. Non-maximum suppresion.
4. Double thresold.
5. Edge tracing by Hysteresis.

  a) Canny : The Canny edge detection algorithm to find the edges in an image.
             The output of this code is a binary image with thin edges, where the pixels that belong to the edges are white and the rest are black.
             Ex: canny = cv2.Canny(img, 170,  250)

==========================================================================================================================================================================================
                                                                     21.  Image Pyramids with Python and OpenCV

An image pyramid is a way of representing an image at different resolutions, which can be useful for image processing tasks such as feature detection, image blending, and edge detection.
      There are two types of image pyramid.
      1. Gaussian Pyramid
      2. Laplacian pyramid

Gaussian Pyramid : A Gaussian pyramid is a technique in image processing that breaks down an image into successively smaller groups of pixels to blur it. It is named after German 
                   mathematician Johann Carl Friederich Gauss.
                   A Gaussian pyramid consists of two steps: smoothing and subsampling.
                            Smoothing is done by applying a Gaussian filter to the image to remove high-frequency components that could cause aliasing.
                            Subsampling is done by reducing the image size by half along each dimension, usually by taking every alternate pixel.

                    There are few function of Guassian Pyramid.
                     1. lr = cv2.pyrDown(img)
                                the code use to downsample an image by a factor of two. 
                                It takes an input image img and returns a smaller image lr that has half the width and height of the original image.
                                This reduces the image size to one-fourth of the original area while preserving the main features of the image.
                    2. cv2.pyrUp(img) 
                               The pyrUp function increases the size of the image to twice its original size in each dimension by inserting zero rows and columns and then convolving the 
                               image with a Gaussian kernel.

Laplacian Pyramid : A level in laplacian pyramid is formed by the difference between that level in Guassian Pyramid and expanded version of its upper level in guassian pyramid.
