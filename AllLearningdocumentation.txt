                                                                          17. MORPHOLOGICAL TRANSFORMATION :
1. Morphological transformation are basically performed on binary images.
2. Morphological transformations are simple operations based on the shape of an image.
3. These operations are fundamental in image processing and are useful for tasks like Noise reduction, object extraction, and boundary detection.

KERNEL : A kernel tell you how to change the value of any given pixel by combining it with different amount of neighouring pixels

Here are the basic morphological operations and how to implement them using OpenCV:
 A) Erosion:
            Erosion erodes away the boundaries of the foreground object (usually white).
            In erosion, it helps shrink the boundaries of white regions (foreground).
            It slides a kernel (a small matrix) over the image and sets a pixel to 1 only if all the pixels under the kernel are 1.
            Useful for removing small white noises and detaching connected objects.
            Example:
                      img = cv2.imread('j.png', cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE) # READ THE IMGAGE IN GRAY SCALE OR YOU CAN SIMPLY PUT THE FLAG ==0
                      kernel = np.ones((5, 5), np.uint8) 
                      erosion = cv2.erode(img, kernel, iterations=1) 
B) Dilation:
            Dilation is the opposite of erosion.
            In dilation, it expands the white regions.
            A pixel becomes 1 if at least one pixel under the kernel is 1.
            Increases the white region in the image or the size of the foreground object.
            Useful for noise removal and joining broken parts of an object.
            Example: 
                      'kernel = np.ones((5, 5), np.uint8) 
                      'dilation = cv2.dilate(img, kernel, iterations=1)
